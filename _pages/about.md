I graduated with a BA in CS from UC Berkeley in 2020.

### Hobbies
I recently picked up biking so hmu if you want to ride together! :)

I also enjoy running. I've been slowly building up my endurance so that once quarantine ends, I can race a 10k. Maybe if I'm feeling extra frisky, I'll sign up for a half-marathon.

Occassionally, I like to binge k-dramas and play league of legends.
